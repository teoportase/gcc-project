Project made alongside the students at Girls Code Club to practice

## Topic - Undertale & Deltarune
Chapters 3 and 4 of *Deltarune* came out recently, so I would like to see how the popularity of the *Undertale* and *Deltarune* pages have changed over the 10 years of history they have

### Dates to look out for
- *Undertale* came out in September 2015
- *Deltarune* Chapter 1 came out in October 2018, Chapter 2 in September 2021, Chapters 3&4 in June 2024

## Presentation
TBD


## How to run
1. Clone the repository on your machine (but you only really need `main.py`)
2. Run `main.py` in your IDE or text editor of your choice that works with Python.
3. Enjoy the graphs!
